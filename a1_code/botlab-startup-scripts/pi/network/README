Edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file with your preferred wifi network 
as the second entry

Copy the wpa_supplicant.conf file to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

If this network cannot be found it will connect to MGuest.

The connection must be made using DHCP, and not static addressing.
Ask about getting a reserved IP associated with your MAC address
on your preferred router
